ExecMindAI is a quiet executive co-pilot. To protect its focus, keep the following non-goals in mind so we avoid feature creep.

* **Not a task manager** — The goal is to structure decisions, not to become another to‑do inbox; use the planner/suggestion flows instead of building elaborate task hierarchy tools.
* **Not an autonomous agent** — ExecMindAI proposes and nudges; it never acts without human consent, so it does not autonomously reschedule meetings or create tasks without explicit approval.
* **Not a notification engine** — We avoid notification spam; suggestions are gentle, infrequent, and contextual rather than noisy alerts bombarding the executive.
* **Not a productivity analytics tool** — The platform logs decision behavior for intelligence, not wellness scoring; it doesn’t rank executives or surface dashboards of “productivity points.”
